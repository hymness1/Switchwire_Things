# Beacon compatible carriage for Voron Switchwire
Based on Trail's V2.4 and Trident [Beacon](https://beacon3d.com/)-comptatible carriage design from [Annex Engineering](https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/Other_Printer_Mods/tree/master/Beacon_Toolheads/VORON%20-%20StealthBurner%20Toolhead) and the Voron Switchwire ClockWork2 carriage design from [Voron Team](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Stealthburner) which provided the STEP files for easy modifications.

This will be tested once I get my Beacon probe in mid-March.
